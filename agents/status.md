# Status Board

Use this page as the human-readable mirror of gents/status.json.

## Updating Rules
- Keep entries sorted by task ID.
- Only tasks with status in_progress or pending belong in **Active Tasks**.
- Move finished items to **Completed Tasks** on the same day they close.
- Include references to supporting artefacts (session files, ADRs, test reports).

## Active Tasks
| Task ID | Agent | Title | Last Update | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|-------|

## Completed Tasks
| Task ID | Agent | Title | Closed On | References |
|---------|-------|-------|-----------|------------|
