    "[x] Review Play Integrity API docs: Accept BOTH MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY and MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY (authenticity priority #1). Documented in sla-definition.md.",
    "[x] Benchmark end-to-end latency: Single sample 2.17s (baseline). Bottleneck: Play Integrity API 1.4s (65%). Conservative estimates: p50≤3s, p95≤5s, p99≤10s. Requires production validation (POI-204).",
    "[x] Define SLA: Created sla-definition.md with 7 sections (upload success ≥99%, latency targets, uptime ≥99.5%, data quality FAR/FRR/entropy, Solana confirmation ≤30s, resilience, Play Integrity verdicts).",
    "",
    "Phase 2 (Documentation) - DONE (2025-11-22):",
    "[x] Write monitoring-strategy.md: 8 Prometheus metrics defined (upload_attempts, latency histogram, validator_up, entropy, etc.), AlertManager rules (3 critical → PagerDuty, 4 warnings → Slack), 2 Grafana dashboards (System Overview 8 panels, Debugging 4 panels), TimescaleDB 90-day retention, Loki/CloudWatch 30-day logs.",
    "[x] Write production-readiness.md: Quality gates (testing, security, monitoring), performance baselines (SLA targets), security requirements (TLS 1.3, OAuth secrets, CVE scan), failure modes & fallbacks (5 scenarios with runbooks), deployment checklist (blue-green, rollback plan), capacity planning (500 batch/s capacity, growth projections).",
    "[x] Update qa-tooling-notes.md: Konkretyzacja tooling - Prometheus metrics table (8 metrics with types/labels), evidence extraction scripts (extract_play_integrity_evidence.sh, extract_validator_grpc_samples.sh, parse_latency_breakdown.sh), AlertManager config (PagerDuty + Slack webhooks), Grafana dashboard specs (panel details), synthetic generator (qa/generator/), load tester (1000 batches/24h), Play Integrity mock (unit tests), Loki LogQL queries, 3-week implementation timeline.",

    "[x] Extract QA-003 evidence: Created evidence/qa-003-validator-grpc-partial.md with 3 gRPC responses (STATUS_ACCEPTED), validator processing ~2ms. PARTIAL: Solana integration blocked by POI-205 (solana_tx=null). Updated test-plan.json with status='partial'.",

    "Phase 4 (Close) - DONE (2025-11-22):",
    "[x] Update PDCA do/check/act with completion details.",

    "[x] Update board.json: POI-103 status in_progress → done, closed_at 2025-11-22."
