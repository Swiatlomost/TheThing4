# TODO: Agent Reorganisation (Cos v0.1 manual cycle)

1. Update backlog/board.json to reflect new task breakdown:
   - ORIN-20251024-001 stays in progress.
   - Add active tasks for Echo, Vireal, Lumen (core + overlay), Kai (core + overlay), Nodus, Nyx, Scribe, Mira, Aurum.
   - Mark completed tasks if obsolete entries remain.
2. Refresh each agent's task.json with current assignments and completed sections.
3. Update log.md (Active Focus, PDCA, decision journal) for Echo, Vireal, Lumen, Kai, Nodus, Nyx, Scribe, Orin to mirror new responsibilities.
4. Update memory.json for the same agents (focus/context/insights/todos/risks) with manual-cycle/overlay responsibilities and encoding-safe text.
5. Ensure Storywright brief reference noted if needed (no change expected).
6. After edits, rerun encoding sanity (UTF-8) via python writers and note in Nyx log.

Status: Completed 2025-10-25.
