# Retro Checklist

> Aurum leads retrospectives using this structure.

## Preparation
- Gather latest `log.md` entries for every agent.
- Review `agents/status.json` to identify stuck items.
- Collect metrics from automation scripts.

## Agenda
1. Opening question: what felt smooth today?
2. Facts: list completed tasks and blockers.
3. Insights: why did events happen the way they did?
4. Decisions: choose 1-2 improvements for the next iteration.

## Output
- Retro report filed in `docs/handbook/retro/` (create folder per week).
- Update affected memories and workflows immediately.
- Confirm owners and deadlines for each improvement.
